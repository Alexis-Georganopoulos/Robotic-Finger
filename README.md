## Syntouch Biotac Robotic Finger: Deducing Force Direction

The Syntouch Biotac is a robotic finger with multiple electrode and pressure sensors that allow for tactile feedback. In this project, I created a neural network that takes in this sensor information and deduces the direction of a tactile force in real-time, mediated by ROS (ie, if the finger is touching something, it knows which direction the apparent force is coming from).<br>
