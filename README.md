## Syntouch Biotac Robotic Finger: Deducing Force Direction

The Syntouch Biotac is a robotic finger with multiple electrode sensors that allow for tactile feedback. In this work, I created a neural network that takes in the sensor information and deduces the direction of a tactile force(ie, if the finger is touching something, it knows which direction the apparent force is coming from).
